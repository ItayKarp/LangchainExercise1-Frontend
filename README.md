A modern AI chat application built with React and powered by a FastAPI backend. Supports real-time streaming responses, persistent chat history, and markdown rendering.

---

## Features

- **Streaming AI responses** — tokens stream in real-time as the model generates them
- **Thinking mode** — displays the model's reasoning process before the response
- **Chat history** — persistent conversations stored server-side, browsable from the sidebar
- **Markdown rendering** — AI responses render with full markdown support (bold, lists, code blocks)
- **Authentication** — JWT-based login, registration, and password reset
- **Auto-scroll** — chat window follows the latest message during streaming
